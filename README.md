# My Personal Site

My personal over-engineering site on the cloud.

## Motivation

> Sharing is learning!

I am a software engineer who loves reading and writing. I document my learnings and achievements in both study and work, hoping that these shares can help others as well.

In addition, I occasionally write about personal life-related topics, such as gourmet food, fitness, and digital products, among others. If you find that we share some common interests, feel free to contact me through the blog comments üòä
